# boat-importer
Simple tool to view and export BOAT (Bund Online Abrechnungs-Tool) data in different reports.

At the moment, this is a standalone tool that requires internet access.

I will add import BOAT3 datasets into an MS SQL database in the future. Then this will consist of an Angular frontend with a reverse proxy for the backend to prevent CORS, a NodeJS backend for the database connection, all packed into two Docker containers.
